GOAL
Create a game where the goal is to guess which pair of capital cities are closer to one another

Distance between capital cities 
	Compare two pairs of cities
	Endless game
	Hints (country / flag?)



need to decide if to keep multi city capital and make sure they aren't chosen together or just decide on one

Should I do the math once and store the distance between every city (~53,000) results or do it on the fly?
