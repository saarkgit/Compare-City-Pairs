# Compare City-Pairs

The goal of this project was to learn some python and apply it into a fun game.

The user gets two random pairs of **capital cities** and then they need to select which pair is closer to one another. Afterwards, they get the option to see the orthographic view of the distances between each pair and the option to play again.

The data for the cities was acquired from [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) and was reduced to capital cities with populations of over 400 as well as some territories' and multi-capital countries' cities being removed for clarity at the authors discretion.
